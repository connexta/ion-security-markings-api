        An indicator that the containing element contains a security-related notice. This attribute is used to categorize which of the required notices is specified in the element. These categories include those described in the Intelligence Community Markings System Register and Manual, as well as additional well-defined and formally recognized security notice types described in other directives, such as US-Person and DoD Distribution. The element could contain any structure that the implementing schema defines, and rendering details are relegated to the implementing schema. The permissible values for this attribute are defined in the ISM Notice CVE: CVEnumISMNotice.xml
      type: string
      example: FISA
    ownerProducer:
      description: >
        The set of national governments and/or international organizations that have purview over the containing classification marking.
      type: string
      example: USA
    joint:
      description: >
        When true, an indicator that entities in the @ism:ownerProducer attribute are JOINT owners of the resource
      type: boolean
      example: false
    pocType:
      description: >
        Indicates that the element specifies a point-of-contact (POC) and the methods with which to contact that individual. As certain POCs are required for different reasons (ICD-710 compliance, DoD Distribution statements, etc), the values for this attribute specify the reason(s) why the POC is provided.
      type: string
      example: ICD-710
    qualifier:
      description: >
        A user-defined property used to provide contextual meaning to the AccessProfileValue
      type: string
      example: Nintendogs # TODO replace with a real example
    releasableTo:
      description: >
        This attribute is used at both the resource and the portion levels. One or more indicators identifying the country or countries and/or international organization(s) to which classified information may be released based on the determination of an originator in accordance with established foreign disclosure procedures. This element is used in conjunction with the Dissemination Controls element. It is manifested in portion marks and security banners. PERMISSIBLE VALUES The permissible values for this attribute are defined in the Controlled Value Enumeration: CVEnumISMRelTo.xml
      type: string
      example: USA
    resourceElement:
      description: >
        This attribute is used to designate which element has the ISM attributes representing the classification for the entire resource. Every document must have at least one element with this indicator as true. It should be rare that a document has more than one. Mainly this would occur in some sort of aggregation schema. In the aggregation case, the first @resourceElement attribute in XML document order is the one used for all constraint rules.
      type: boolean
      example: true
    SARIdentifier:
      description: >
        This attribute is used at both the resource and the portion levels. One or more indicators identifying the defense or intelligence programs for which special access is required. It is manifested in portion marks and security banners. PERMISSIBLE VALUES The permissible values for this attribute are defined in the Controlled Value Enumeration: CVEnumISMSAR.xml
      type: string
      example: SAR-E for not thinking of a better example # TODO replace with a real example
    SCIControls:
      description: >
        This attribute is used at both the resource and the portion levels. One or more indicators identifying sensitive compartmented information control system(s). It is manifested in portion marks and security banners. PERMISSIBLE VALUES The permissible values for this attribute are defined in the Controlled Value Enumeration: CVEnumISMSCIControls.xml
      type: string
      example: BUR
    typeOfExemptedSource:
      description: >
        This attribute is used primarily at the resource level. A declassification marking of a source document that causes the current, derivative document to be exempted from automatic declassification. This element is always used in conjunction with the Date Of Exempted Source element. It is manifested only in the 'Declassify On' line of a document's classification/declassification block. This element is defined as NMTOKENS but ISOO has stated it should be a SINGLE value giving the longest protection. PERMISSIBLE VALUE The permissible value for this attribute is defined in the Implementation Profile Supplement: Value Enumerations in the value set: Source Document Declassification Instruction Marking
      type: string
      example: Document
    unregisteredNoticeType:
      description: >
        A notice that is of a category that is not described in the Intelligence Community Markings System Register and Manual and/or is not sufficiently defined to be represented in the Controlled Value Enumeration CVEnumISMNotice.xml. This attribute can be used by specifications that import ISM to represent a wider variety of security-related notices.
      type: string
      example: TODO
    # End ISM definitions
